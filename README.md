#Description

This project is a simple face recognition system using OpenCV, where face data is collected from the webcam and stored for future recognition. 
The data is stored as resized face images and corresponding names, allowing for potential recognition with algorithms like KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
The project collects facial data through a webcam and stores the data in pickle files for later use. The collected data includes:
Face images resized to 50x50 pixels.
Corresponding names for the faces captured.

#Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV (opencv-python)
NumPy (numpy)
